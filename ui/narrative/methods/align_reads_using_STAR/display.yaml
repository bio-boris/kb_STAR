    <p>The STAR app aligns the sequencing reads for a single or a set of two (paired end) reads to long reference sequences of a prokaryotic genome using the STAR alignment program, written by Alexander Dobin (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23104886).</p> 
    <p>Basic STAR work flow consists of 2 steps:</p>
    <p>1. Generating genome indexes files: In this step user supplied the reference genome sequences (FASTA files) and annotations (GTF file), from which STAR generate genome indexes that are utilized in the 2nd (mapping) step. The genome indexes are saved to disk and need only be generated once for each genome/annotation combination.
    </p>
    <p>2. Mapping reads to the genome: In this step user supplies the genome files generated in the 1st step, as well as the RNA-seq reads (sequences) in the form of FASTA or FASTQ files. STAR maps the reads to the genome, and writes several output files, such as alignments (SAM/BAM), mapping summary statistics, splice junctions, unmapped reads, signal (wiggle) tracks etc.
